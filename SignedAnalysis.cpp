//===- ZeroAnalysis.cpp - Transfer functions ------------------------------===//
//
// The transfer function: given what is known about an operation's operands,
// state what is known about its results.  This file and ZeroDomain.h are the
// two to replace when building a different analysis; the rest of the project
// is scaffolding.
//
// There are deliberately only two rules here, one of each kind an analysis
// needs: one that introduces facts out of nothing (constants), and one that
// propagates facts it was given (`and`).  Everything else is unknown.  Adding
// a third rule should be a matter of adding a third `if`.
